### What is PowerBeard? ###
PowerBeard is a PowerShell module that helps a user interact with the SickBeard API
in a way that is familiar to PowerShell users.

### How do I get set up? ###

1. Open PowerShell and type the following $env:PSModulePath
the output will show all of the locations you can copy the module to. 
2. Just pick one of the returned paths and copy the PowerBeard folder there.
3. Run the cmdlet "import-module PowerBeard"  and you should be good to go!
4. You can use the cmdlet "get-help PowerBeard" to show a list of functions and their Synopsis.
